    "The main reason for what use __$t$-SNE__ is __visualization__ of high dimentional data. Because of _\"similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points with high probability\"_ [[wiki]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding), this approache has been used for clusters dividing understanding.\n",
    "In other words, method solves _\"the crowding problem\"_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method is inefficient with size of data samples growing, $O(n^2)$ speed (pairwise distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, __$t$-SNE__ is not deterministic (stochasticity of final solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "While our method map neighbors (local) quite well, with global trends it seems to represent the whole picture not correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, with input data dimension increasing, best linear combination in terms of variance explained are far and far away from real representing.\n",
    "\n",
    "__$t$-SNE__ can not handle incomplete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters (perplexity) tuning is one more problem to deal with in a proper way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Native __$t$-SNE__ (without additional solution) does not map new, unseen samples."
